My Project
This is the continuation from the previous tutorial: GIT and GitHub - 4. GitHub Account and SSH Key.

In this section, we'll upload our project to GitHub.


 

I have a C++/Qt5 project that does simple thing: progress bar is linked to moving slider:

The project (HelloGitHub) files are in "C:\MyGit\GitProjects" directory:

Now we want to upload the project to GitHub.





Putting Project to Local Repository
Let's start with Git Bash.

First, we need to go into the project directory. Then git init to make the project directory to be a repository. After that, put the files into the staging area by git add <file>

Some of the VS2012 files won't allowed to open, but those are kind of temporary but not needed to be put into repository. So, I staged each file individually.

If we do git stat:

Now, put them into our local repository, git commit -m "initial commit":

git_commit_m_initial_commit.png

We can check the log, git log:

Uploading - git push

shortname
To add a new remote Git repository as a shortname we can reference easily, we run

git remote add [shortname] [url]
What url we should use?

Go to the GitHub page:

select_repository.png

Select the repository, in this case, "git-demo" and get the url as shown in the picture below:

GetURL.png

We set the short for the remote repository:

uploading - git push
Finally, we're ready to upload. We'll use push. git push updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary to complete the given refs. Since our local repository now knows the short name for remote repository, we can easily upload our project files:

Note that we pushed master branch.





Check GitHub Uploading
We can check if our upload was done correctly.

Just refresh the page:
