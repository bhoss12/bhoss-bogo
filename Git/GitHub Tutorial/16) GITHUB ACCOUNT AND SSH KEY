Then, a guide page pops up that has git commands which are familiar to us now:

How to connect to GitHub Account
To upload to GitHub, we need to setup couple of things on client side:

Create SSH key - we'll be using RSA public/private cryptography
HTTPS or SSH - either one will work but GitHub prefers SHH


Creating SSH Key
We want to create a SSH key.

Type in ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "email_address" where -t allows us to set the key type:

Then, go to the personal folder:

SSH Key to GitHub
Now we want to copy the key and put that into the SSH section of GitHub.

Copy the key:

In GitHub site, Account Setting>SSH keys>Add SSH Key. Paste the key we copied. Then, click "Add key".

Checking SSH
We can check if it really works by running ssh -T git@github.com command:
